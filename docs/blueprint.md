# **App Name**: Rudram 3D DataView

## Core Features:

- Interactive 3D Hero Section: Display a dynamic hero section with animated 3D elements, a headline formed from scattered particles, and a multi-layer parallax background. Users can interact with the data particles using their cursor.
- Data Clarity Path: Present a 3-step path to data clarity using a horizontal holographic timeline with floating cards. Each step features 3D zoom and slide animations, with connecting lines that glow like energy circuits.
- Why Choose Rudram Section: Showcase reasons to choose Rudram with holographic info-cards arranged in a grid. Cards flip in 3D on hover, revealing supporting text.
- Case Story Carousel: Implement a rotating 3D carousel displaying "Before â†’ After" case tiles. Stats animate live within the tiles.
- FAQ Generator: AI tool to adapt existing FAQ content into dynamic Q&A panels with 3D accordion effects and subtle animations, plus related "micro-CTAs" for each.
- Contact Section with Holographic Map: Create a glass-morphic contact form with a moving holographic map grid background. Integrate Calendly in a glowing hologram window.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant teal (#008080) to convey a sense of clarity, trust, and futuristic solutions. (Note: avoids the cliche of greens for financial apps).
- Background color: Very light teal (#E0F8F8), almost white, to provide a clean and modern backdrop that complements the 3D elements and ensures readability.
- Accent color: Analogous blue (#000080), darker and more saturated than the primary color, for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action. Adds depth and sophistication.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a techy feel, for both headlines and short amounts of body text.
- Use glowing, minimalist icons to represent data concepts, clarity, and solutions. Icons should integrate seamlessly with the 3D holographic design.
- Employ a multi-layered parallax scrolling effect to create depth and immersion. Utilize floating elements and glass-morphic containers to enhance the futuristic aesthetic.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as particle formations, 3D zooms, and glowing circuit lines, to enhance interactivity and engagement. Ensure animations are smooth and do not overwhelm the user.
