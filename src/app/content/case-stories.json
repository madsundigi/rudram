      "content": "A mid-sized manufacturing client was struggling with inventory management. They knew there were inefficiencies but couldn't pinpoint them in their scattered data.\n\nOur Data Health Check connected their procurement, production, and waste management systems. We deployed a unified data model to track material flow from entry to exit.\n\nWithin two weeks, we identified a consistent material leakage issue in one of their production lines, amounting to nearly AUD 600k in annual losses. We built a simple, real-time dashboard to monitor this variance, allowing them to fix the process and prevent future losses.",

We standardized formats, removed thousands of duplicates, and enriched the data with property preferences and historical engagement data.\n\nThe result was a clean, segmented database that powered a new automated marketing pipeline, increasing lead qualification rates by 40% and boosting agent productivity.",

The process was manual, error-prone, and took days each month, delaying critical financial insights.\n\nWe developed a centralized Data App that connected directly to their accounting software and other financial data sources. It automated all their standard reports—P&L, cash flow, and departmental budgets—into a single, interactive dashboard.\n\nThis reduced their monthly reporting time by 90% and completely eliminated manual data entry errors, freeing the team to focus on strategic financial analysis instead of data wrangling.",
