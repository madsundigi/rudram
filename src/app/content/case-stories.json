      "content": "A mid-sized manufacturing client was struggling with inventory management. They knew there were inefficiencies but couldn't pinpoint them in their scattered data.\n\nOur Data Health Check connected their procurement, production, and waste management systems. We deployed a unified data model to track material flow from entry to exit.\n\nWe identified a consistent material leakage issue in one of their production lines, amounting to nearly $AUD 600,000 in annual losses. We built a simple, real-time dashboard to monitor this variance, allowing them to fix the process and prevent future losses.",

It automated all their standard reports—P&L, cash flow, and departmental budgets—into a single, interactive dashboard.\n\nThis reduced their monthly reporting time by 90% and completely eliminated manual data entry errors, freeing the team to focus on strategic financial analysis instead of data wrangling.",
